# Day 18 – Dynamic PDF Invoice Generator with Export, Signature & QR Code

This project is part of my 150-day developer preparation journey, focused on building deliverables that feel like real product features. On Day 18, I built a fully functional PDF generator using React — converting user form input into a styled invoice layout and allowing export as a downloadable PDF.

## ✅ What I Practiced:
- JSX-based invoice layout with tailwind styling  
- Form input for client name, address, items, totals  
- PDF conversion using `jsPDF` or `html2pdf.js`  
- Controlled export via button trigger  
- Signature canvas for user acknowledgment  
- QR code embed for invoice ID or payment URL  
- Tailwind layout optimized for print formats

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered:
- Client-side PDF rendering from HTML/JSX  
- Form handling and state management  
- Custom layout design for headers, rows, totals  
- Triggering export/download with precision  
- Canvas signature capture  
- QR code rendering with dynamic value

## 🛠 Features:
- Form captures invoice data (name, items, amount, etc.)  
- Styled layout preview resembling formal invoice  
- PDF export on button click  
- Optional features: signature canvas, QR code embed  
- Toast feedback or download confirmation  
- Theme control and print-friendly layout options

## ⚙️ Tech Stack:
- React.js (Hooks + JSX)  
- Tailwind CSS  
- jsPDF or html2pdf.js  
- react-signature-canvas (optional)  
- react-qr-code (optional)

## 🔥 Why This Matters:
Invoices, offer letters, statements — every product eventually needs clean, exportable PDFs. This build simulates what actual platforms deliver across HR, legal, finance, and operations. Designing for print isn’t just formatting — it’s trust and clarity.

> Day 18 complete. From input form to export-ready document — this is product logic, not a demo.
